    "hWelcome": "MeteoNook is a weather forecaster for <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i> {version}.%%This tool will predict your island's weather patterns, including exact times for meteor showers, rainbows and the aurora borealis. To get started, you'll need the seed, a long number unique to your island that determines what your weather will be. Follow the instructions on the <b>Seed</b> tab to find it.",
    "hTLog": "Changelog",
    "hLog20200702": "Initial support for 1.3.0. There are still a couple of necessary changes (Fine02 and Fine06 have changed slightly) which will be implemented tomorrow.",
    "hLog20200708": "Full support for 1.3.0. Light showers are now shown on the Overview tab.",
    "hTFAQ": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "hQSeed": "Will my seed change if I time travel?",
    "hASeed": "No. It's picked randomly when you create your island and never changes.",
    "hQCeleste": "Where is Celeste?",
    "hACeleste": "At the start of the week, the game picks a random day for Celeste to appear out of the days that have meteor showers. This is fully random and not based on the seed, and cannot be predicted.",
    "hQWind": "What does the üçÉ mean?",
    "hAWind": "The number represents the strength or speed of the wind. 0 is completely calm, 1 is a breeze, and 5 is the maximum that you can get in AC:NH. It does nothing useful whatsoever, but the effect it has on items like palm trees and the clothes line is quite amusing.",
    "hQStarVis": "Why are the times for stars greyed out or in bold on the Overview tab?",
    "hAStarVis": "During a light shower, you have a small random chance of seeing five shooting stars every minute between 19H and 04H. MeteoNook analyses the schedule to try and figure out when multiple groups of stars appear close to each other. The times in <span class='cluster-dense'>bold</span> are when you can expect to see quite a few stars. On the other hand, the times that are <span class='cluster-light'>faded out</span> are when stars are few and far between.%%This lets you see at a glance roughly when to play if you want to get more. Of course, you can always click 'see more' for exact times.",
    "hQStar130": "Why am I seeing more shooting stars with the same seed than I did before?",
    "hAStar130": "Seeds have <u>not</u> changed, but version 1.3.0 (the Summer Update Wave 1, where diving was added) has changed a couple of aspects in the weather system. Previously, during a light shower, shooting stars could only appear between 19H and 04H in hours where the weather was <b>clear/fine</b>. In 1.3.0, they can also appear during hours when the weather is <b>sunny</b>.%%Two of the three 'light shower' patterns have also been changed. Fine02 is now cloudy at 18H and sunny at 19H (previously the other way round), and Fine06 is now cloudy at 17H and sunny at 19H (previously the other way round). The seed finder will accept both the old and new versions of these patterns.",
    "hQMoreData": "Why does it say I need more data?",
    "hAMoreData": "There are over 2 billion possible weather seeds, but only one is correct for your island. MeteoNook goes through every single possibility, calculates the weather it would give, and checks it against the data you provide. If it doesn't make sense (e.g. you said you had rain at a given time, but the seed would make it sunny) then that possibility is ignored.%%During testing, we've had success with the following combinations...%%-The known dates for between 5 and 7 heavy showers%%-The known hour and minute times for stars in a light shower, spanning between 1 and 3 hours%%-The known hour, minute and second times for a few different stars in a light shower%%-The known dates and times for between 5 and 7 rainbows%%It is of course heavily randomised, though. You might get lucky and find yours with less information, or you might need more!",
    "hQNoSeeds": "Why can't it find my seed?",
    "hANoSeeds": "One mistake in the data you enter will be enough to stop MeteoNook from finding the correct seed. This tends to happen with weather types, as it's easy to mix them up. If you're not completely sure, then select the appropriate \"not sure\" option. It doesn't narrow down the options as quickly as selecting a specific type, but it's less risky - a slow but correct result is better than no result!",
    "hQBadSeed": "It gave me a seed, but the results are wrong!",
    "hABadSeed": "This happens sometimes, it sucks. What's most likely happened is that there was a mistake somewhere in your data and MeteoNook has found a seed which fits what you asked for, but doesn't actually match what your island uses. Try changing your weather types to \"not sure\", just in case it's a mistake with cloud types. If that doesn't help, you may have to collect new data.",
    "hQAdd": "Will you add X...?",
    "hAAdd": "Maybe. No promises.",
    "hQDonate": "Can I give you money?",
    "hADonate": "Since a few people asked me on Discord and Twitter, I've added some links to the footer. Please don't feel obligated to do so, though!",
    "hQSource": "Will this be open source?",
    "hASource": "This new version of MeteoNook is available on GitHub under the GNU Affero GPL 3.0. The repository link is at the bottom of this page.",
    "sIntro": "Before you can forecast your island's weather, you'll need to determine what weather seed it has. This tool will find it for you once you've provided enough data about your island's weather. The more information you provide, the easier it will be!",
    "sTTypes": "Weather Types",
    "sTypes1": "Each hour in Animal Crossing has a type of weather - clear ‚òÄÔ∏è, sunny üå§, cloudy üå•Ô∏èÔ∏è, rain clouds ‚òÅ, rain/snow üåß and heavy rain/snow ‚õàÔ∏è. If you know what type you have in a particular hour, then add it in this section.",
    "sTypes2": "Clouds are easiest to identify at the start of the hour (X:00), so if the sky is fully clear at 13:00, then 13H is definitely <b>clear ‚òÄÔ∏è</b>. At 13:30, the weather will be a mix of the 13H weather and the 14H weather.%%Rain and snow last for the whole hour, so if you see rain at any point between 13H and 14H, then 13H is definitely <b>rain/snow üåß</b> or <b>heavy rain/snow ‚õàÔ∏è</b>.%%If you're not sure about the cloud type within a given hour, you can pick one of the 'Not sure' options.%%You don't need to enter these on days where you've seen a heavy shower, rainbow or aurora borealis, because that information is good enough to pin down that day's pattern perfectly.",
    "sTStars": "Shooting Star Times",
    "sStars": "If you note down the exact in-game time (hour and minute) when shooting stars have appeared during a meteor shower, then this information will help the process. You will always get 5 or 8 shooting stars in a minute where they appear.%%If you're sure that there are no stars in a specific time period, you can add it to the Gaps section to help the algorithm out. The <b>Make from Times</b> button will automatically create gaps between every time you've put in.%%By clicking <b>Edit Seconds</b>, you can add down-to-the-second times for each star. This is a very good way to find your seed quickly, but it can be very difficult to get the timing correct as the in-game clock doesn't show seconds.%%<b>Heavy showers</b> will give you 5 or 8 stars a minute, very frequently (every other minute on average), between 19H and 04H. <b>Light showers</b> will give you 5 stars a minute, in very rare bursts.",
    "sTTips": "Tips",
    "sTips": "-Don't put info in if you're not completely sure about it.%%-Look through screenshots and videos you've taken <b>on your island</b> (not on Nook Miles Ticket islands or when visiting other players) for records of your weather. In the Switch album, you can press A to see the date and time they were taken.
